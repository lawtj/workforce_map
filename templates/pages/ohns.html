                <p>The Global OHNS initiative performed a recent study quantifying the number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) care clinicians per capita worldwide. This was done by disseminating a cross-sectional electronic survey to professional society leaders, medical licensing boards, public health officials, and practicing OHNS clinicians. </p>
                <p>Respondents from 114 countries comprising 84% of the world population estimate a workforce density of 2.19 OHNS clinicians per 100â€¯000 population. Variations were noted by World Health Organization regions and World Bank income groups.</p>
                <p>This cross-sectional survey study provides a comprehensive assessment of the global OHNS workforce. These results can guide focused investment in training and policy development to address disparities in the availability of OHNS clinicians.</p>
                <p>Below are interactive maps to display the results from this study.</p>
